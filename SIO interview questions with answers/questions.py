Question 1:
    1.1 create a list 'l1' which contains the first 10 powers of 2
    1.2 create a list 'l2' which contains the strings: "a1", "a2", "a3",... "a100"
    1.3 create a list 'l3' which contains only the first 10 items from 'l2'
    1.4 create a list 'l4' which contains only the last 15 items from 'l2'
    1.5 create a list 'l5' which is a copy of 'l2'

Question 2:
    create a list which contains all letters from 'a' to 'z'
    Clues:
        i = ord('a')
        c = chr(i)

Question 3:
    Implement function 'is_unique' which gets a string and:
        returns True if all the characters appears only once
        returns False if there are characters which appear more than once

Question 4:
    Implement function 'is_perm' which gets two strings 's1', 's2', and:
        returns True if 's1' is a permutation of 's2'
        returns False if 's1' is not a permutation of 's2'

Question 5:
    Implement function 'evaluate' which gets a strings representing mathematical calculation for example:
    "5 + 3 + 12"
    or
    "- 1 + 9 - 3 + 5"
        The function should return the result of the calculation
        Assume the string is legal, and space always exist between sign and number.

Question 6:
    Implement function 'sort_by_color' which gets a list of strings, the strings can be:
    "red", "green"
        The function should return the list sorted by color:
        "red" and then "green"

    There are two ways to ask this question:
        1. Allow using additional list which will contain the sorted colors - basic
        2. Sort the colors in-place inside the list (without adding additional list) - advanced
